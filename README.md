This is my personal config files, feel free to use them as you like.

They are tested with 1 and 2 monitors, but they should work with more than since they are based on [dmwit's config](https://wiki.haskell.org/Xmonad/Config_archive/dmwit%27s_xmonad.hs).

All the files in this repo should go under `~/.xmonad`.
